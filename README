tdCorePlugin
======================

The `tdVisitorCounterPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides basic
functionalities enabling TD CMS, such as common configuration or random data
generation.

This plugin is a part of __TD CMF__ and is based on __Doctrine ORM__.

Installation
============

Install the plugin via the subversion repository by executing the following
command from the project root directory:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/tdCorePlugin/trunk plugins/tdCorePlugin

or by using the default symfony plugin install command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install -s beta tdCorePlugin

as the actual release is in its beta stage.

Usage
=====

  * This plugin is the main part of the __TD CMS__ and therefore it should be
    installed as the first one. Other td components will use functionalities
    provided with tdCorePlugin.

Random Data Generator
=====================

There is a class in the plugin responsible for generating some random data used
for the symfony fixtures. During development phase its essential to see how some
mechanisms work when real data is available in the database. Writing the same
methods many times is useless - that's where random data generator comes in. an
example to generate some data in _data/fixtures/sample.yml_ file is shown below:

    [php]
    <?php $generator = new tdRandomDataGenerator(); ?>
    Guestbook:
    <?php for($i = 0; $i < 150; $i++): ?>
      guestbook_<?php echo $i ?>:
        author: <?php echo $generator->getRandomName()."\n" ?>
        email: <?php echo $generator->getRandomEmail()."\n" ?>
        http: <?php echo $generator->getRandomHttp()."\n" ?>
        text: <?php echo $generator->getRandomText(mt_rand(20,100)*mt_rand(1,5))."\n" ?>
    <?php endfor; ?>
